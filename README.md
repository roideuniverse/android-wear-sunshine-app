#android-nanodegree-project #6 Go Ubiquitous

Build a wearable watch face for Sunshine to run on an Android Wear device.

##Why this Project?
Android Wear is an exciting way to integrate your app more directly into users’ lives. As a new developer, it will be important for you to understand how to perform this integration. This project gives you an opportunity to design a companion app for Sunshine, tying it to a watch face in order to enrich the experience.

##What Will I Learn?
1. Understand the fundamentals of Android Wear.
2. Design for multiple watch form factors.
3. Communicate between a mobile device and a wearable device.

##Requirements
1. App works on both round and square face watches.
2. App displays the current time.
3. App displays the high and low temperatures.
4. App displays a graphic that summarizes the day’s weather (e.g., a sunny image, rainy image, cloudy image, etc.).
